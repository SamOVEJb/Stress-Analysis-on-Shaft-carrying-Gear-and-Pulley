# Stress-Analysis-on-Shaft-carrying-Gear-and-Pulley
This project investigates the mechanical behavior of a shaft subjected to combined loading due to a gear and a pulley mounted at different positions. The objective is to analyze the stress distribution, deformation, and fatigue life of the shaft under real-world operating conditions.
