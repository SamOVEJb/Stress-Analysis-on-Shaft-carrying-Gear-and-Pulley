# Stress Analysis on Shaft Carrying Gear and Pulley

## Overview
This project investigates the mechanical behavior of a **shaft subjected to combined loading** due to a gear and a pulley mounted at different positions. The objective is to analyze the **stress distribution, deformation, and fatigue life** of the shaft under real-world operating conditions.

## Key Objectives
- **Stress Distribution Analysis:** Evaluate bending, torsional, and axial stresses induced by the gear and pulley system.
- **Deformation Study:** Assess shaft deflection and strain under operational loads.
- **Fatigue Life Prediction:** Estimate the shaft’s lifespan under cyclic loading conditions.

## Methodology
### 1️⃣ Analytical Calculations
- **Bending Moments & Shear Forces:** Derived using beam theory and free-body diagrams.
- **Torsional Stress Calculation:** Based on torque transmission from gear and pulley.
- **Axial Load Consideration:** Accounting for any axial thrust from gear engagement.

### 2️⃣ Finite Element Analysis (FEA)
- **3D Modeling:** Created using CAD software.
- **Simulation in Abaqus/ANSYS:** Applying real-world constraints and loads.
- **Stress & Deformation Analysis:** Identifying high-stress regions and critical failure points.

### 3️⃣ Fatigue and Failure Analysis
- **Fatigue Life Estimation:** Using S-N curves and Miner’s Rule.
